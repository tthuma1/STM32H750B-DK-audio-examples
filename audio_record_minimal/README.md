# STM32H750B-DK Minimal Audio Record Example

The following tutorial presents how to record audio through the built-in PDM MEMS microphone (IMP34DT05TR, marked as U34) and play it back through the Line Out port (green TRS 3.5mm, PJ-3028, marked as CN9) on STM32H750B-DK.
The project is created with STM32CubeMX v6.17.0 with STM32CubeH7 MCU Firmware Package v1.13.0; STM32CubeIDE v2.1.1 was used for building and flashing.

Enabling D- and I-cache is not necessary in this project, but is kept as a good practice for audio processing on embedded systems. The same is true for using the HSE clock as the source clock for SAI instead of HSI.

# Project overview

The on-board MEMS microphone outputs a 1-bit PDM stream that a serial-audio peripheral clocks
into RAM via DMA. The CPU converts the PDM to 16-bit stereo PCM in the DMA interrupts and writes
it into a playback buffer. A second DMA streams that PCM out through another serial-audio
peripheral to the external codec chip, which does the digital-to-analog conversion and drives the
line-out jack.

```

### Peripherals used

**MEMS microphone (IMP34DT05TR)**: on-board digital MEMS microphone. It outputs a
1-bit-per-sample **PDM** (Pulse-Density Modulation) bitstream on one data line. The driver treats
it as a stereo PDM pair (LR) and samples both the rising and falling edges of the mic clock, so the
left and right channels are both drawn from this one microphone.

**PDM (Pulse-Density Modulation)**: the 1-bit oversampled format the mic emits. It doesn't contain PCM samples 
directly, so the high-rate bitstream has to be low-pass filtered and downsampled into 16-bit PCM. This PDM→PCM
conversion is done by the CPU (`BSP_AUDIO_IN_PDMToPCM()`) inside the record DMA callbacks.

**SAI (Serial Audio Interface)**: the peripheral that serializes PCM samples onto an audio bus. It is
split into two independent blocks, *Block A* and *Block B*, each with its own clock, FIFO and
pins. This project uses two SAI instances:

- **SAI4 Block A** as the **receiver** in PDM mode: it supplies the mic clock and samples the
  incoming PDM bitstream from the microphone.
- **SAI2 Block A** as the **transmitter** to the codec. It generates four wires:
  - **SD** (serial data, PI6)
  - **SCK** (bit clock, PI5)
  - **FS** (frame sync / word select, PI7): indicates the start of the serial data (start of the frame)
  - **MCLK** (master clock, PI4): a high-frequency reference clock (multiple of the audio sample rate `Fs`) that synchronizes the audio data transfer and the codec

  All four SAI2 pins are configured for their respective functions with alternate-function **AF10**.

**I2S**: the framing protocol used on the SAI2-to-WM8994 link (Philips I²S
standard: MSB-first, data delayed one bit after FS, FS low = left channel; 32-bit slot (L+R), 16-bit data).

**WM8994**: Cirrus stereo codec that receives the I2S stream,
performs the D/A conversion and amplifies the result to the Line-Out / headphone jack. Its control registers (input routing, DAC path,
volume, power) are configured by the BSP driver over **I2C4**.

**DMA (Direct Memory Access)**: moves audio buffers between SRAM and the SAI data registers with
no CPU involvement.  Two separate DMA controllers are used, one per direction:

- **BDMA Channel 1** (record): moves the PDM bitstream from `SAI4_A` into `recordPDMBuf`,
  **circular**, 16-bit. BDMA lives in the D3 domain and is the only DMA that can
  reach the SAI4 peripheral; it can also only access **D3 SRAM** (`0x38000000`), which is why
  `recordPDMBuf` is forced there.
- **DMA2 Stream 1** (playback): mapped to the `SAI2_A` request, memory→peripheral, **circular**,
  16-bit. It streams the PCM ring buffer out to the codec.

The DMA is organized into **streams**; each stream is wired to one
peripheral request.
**Circular** means that when the controller reaches the end of the buffer it wraps to the start
and keeps going forever. Both DMAs raise half-transfer and transfer-complete interrupts that
drive the buffer handling.

### Gapless audio transmission with double-buffering

The audio buffer is treated as two halves. The DMA raises an interrupt at the buffer
midpoint (**half-transfer**) and at the end (**transfer-complete**). On half-transfer the DMA is
now playing the second half, so the CPU regenerates the first half; on transfer-complete it
is playing the first half, so the CPU refills the second.

Because the D-Cache is enabled, after the CPU writes samples it must
`SCB_CleanDCache_by_Addr()` that region so the DMA reads the fresh data from SRAM and not stale
cache. The buffer is `ALIGN_32BYTES` to match the 32-byte cache-line granularity of those
maintenance operations.

### Clocking

- **CPU / bus clocks** come from **HSI** (the 64 MHz internal RC oscillator).
- **The audio sample clock** must be exact, so it is derived from **HSE** (the board's external
  25 MHz crystal) through PLL2, set up inside the BSP driver's `MX_SAI2_ClockConfig()`. PLL2 is used as a source clock for SAI2. For the
  48 kHz family (which includes 96 kHz, currently used in this project) PLL2 produces ≈49.14 MHz
  (HSE 25 MHz ÷ PLL2M 25 = 1 MHz VCO input, ×PLL2N 344 = 344 MHz, ÷PLL2P 7), which the SAI then
  divides down to the exact MCLK and SCK for the requested Fs.

### Schematics

It may be useful to take a look at the schematic, taken from https://www.st.com/resource/en/schematic_pack/mb1381-h750xb-b04.pdf.

# 1. Create the project

- Create a new project in CubeMX.
- Select the STM32H750XBH MCU.
- When asked about configuring the MPU, it doesn't matter what you pick (I picked Yes in this project).

# 2. Configure basics in CubeMX

The BSP driver that we will import later requires the PDM2PCM library, even though we won't be using any of its functionalities in this project.
The PDM2PCM library is only needed for recording audio.

- Activate CRC under `Computing` -> `CRC`.
- Activate PDM2PCM under `Middleware and Software Packs` -> `PDM2PCM`.
- Set the toolchain in `Project Manager` tab to STM32CubeIDE and click `Generate Code`.

# 3. Add driver files

CubeMX does not generate the audio drivers, so you must copy them
in by hand.

STM32CubeMX downloads the STM32CubeH7 MCU Firmware Package (MCU FP) to `~/STM32Cube/Repository/STM32Cube_FW_H7_Vx.x.x`.
If you do not have it, download it from
https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubeh7.html#get-software.

In the table below, each file lives at the **same relative path** in both places: copy it from
that path under the MCU FP root into the same path under your project root.

| Files to copy | Relative path (same in MCU FP and your project) |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `stm32h7xx_hal_sai.h`, `stm32h7xx_hal_sai_ex.h` | `Drivers/STM32H7xx_HAL_Driver/Inc` |
| `stm32h7xx_hal_sai.c`, `stm32h7xx_hal_sai_ex.c` | `Drivers/STM32H7xx_HAL_Driver/Src` |
| `stm32h750b_discovery_audio.{c,h}`, `stm32h750b_discovery_bus.{c,h}`, `stm32h750b_discovery_errno.h` | `Drivers/BSP/STM32H750B-DK` |
| entire `wm8994` folder | `Drivers/BSP/Components/wm8994` |
| `audio.h` | `Drivers/BSP/Components/Common` |

Then create the BSP config header by copying the template and renaming it (in
`Drivers/BSP/STM32H750B-DK`):

- `stm32h750b_discovery_conf_template.h` → `stm32h750b_discovery_conf.h`

# 4. Add code

Add the following code to `STM32H750XBHX_FLASH.ld` inside the `SECTIONS` block (e.g. after the `.bss` block):
```
  .D3_SRAM  (NOLOAD) : { *(.D3_SRAM*)  } >RAM_D3

Open the project in STM32CubeIDE and navigate to `Project` → `Properties` → `C/C++ Build` → `Settings` → `MCU/MPU GCC Compiler` → `Include Paths`:
  - Add `../Drivers/BSP/STM32H750B-DK` under `Include paths (-I)`

# 6. Build and flash the project

Build and flash the project from STM32CubeIDE.

# Notes

Adjust your speaker/headphones volume before running this example. Volume can also be changed through `AudioOutInit.Volume` and `AudioInInit.Volume` in `main.c`.
