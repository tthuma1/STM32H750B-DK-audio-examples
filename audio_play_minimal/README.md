# STM32H750B-DK Minimal Audio Play Example

The following tutorial presents how to play audio through the built-in Line Out port (green TRS 3.5mm, PJ-3028, marked as CN9) on STM32H750B-DK.
The project is created with STM32CubeMX v6.17.0 with STM32CubeH7 MCU Firmware Package v1.13.0; STM32CubeIDE v2.1.1 was used for building and flashing.

Enabling D- and I-cache is not necessary in this project, but is kept as a good practice for audio processing on embedded systems. The same is true for using the HSE clock as the source clock for SAI instead of HSI.

# Project overview

The MCU generates 16-bit stereo PCM samples in RAM, hands
the buffer to a DMA engine that streams it to a serial-audio peripheral, which clocks the bits
out to the external codec chip that does the digital-to-analog conversion and drives the line-out
jack.

### Data flow:

```
SRAM buffer (filled with GenerateTone())
   ▼  DMA2_Stream1  (circular, mem→periph, request SAI2_A)
SAI2 Block A TX
   │
   I2S transmission protocol
   │
   ▼
WM8994 codec  (control registers are set over I2C4)
   ▼
green Line Out jack
```

### Peripherals used

**SAI (Serial Audio Interface)**: the peripheral that serializes PCM samples onto an
audio bus. It is split into two independent blocks, *Block A* and *Block B*,
each with its own clock, FIFO and pins. This project
uses **SAI2 Block A** as the transmitter. The SAI generates four wires:

- **SD** (serial data, PI6)
- **SCK** (bit clock, PI5)
- **FS** (frame sync / word select, PI7): indicates the start of the serial data (start of the frame)
- **MCLK** (master clock, PI4): a high-frequency reference clock (multiple of the audio sample rate `Fs`) that synchronizes the audio data transfer and the codec

All four pins are configured for their respective functions with alternate-function **AF10**.

**I2S**: the framing protocol used between SAI2 and WM8994 (Philips I²S
standard: MSB-first, data delayed one bit after FS, FS low = left channel; 32-bit slot (L+R), 16-bit data).

**WM8994**: Cirrus stereo codec that receives the I2S stream,
performs the D/A conversion and amplifies the result to the Line-Out / headphone jack. Its control registers (input routing, DAC path,
volume, power) are configured by the BSP driver over **I2C4**.

**DMA (Direct Memory Access)**: moves the sample buffer from SRAM into the SAI's data register
with no CPU involvement. The DMA is organized into **streams**; each stream is wired to one
peripheral request. Here **DMA2 Stream 1** is mapped to the `SAI2_A` request, configured
memory→peripheral, **circular**, 16-bit. Circular means that when the stream reaches the end of
the buffer it wraps to the start and keeps going forever.

### Gapless audio transmission with double-buffering

The audio buffer is treated as two halves. The DMA raises an interrupt at the buffer
midpoint (**half-transfer**) and at the end (**transfer-complete**). On half-transfer the DMA is
now playing the second half, so the CPU regenerates the first half; on transfer-complete it
is playing the first half, so the CPU refills the second.

Because the D-Cache is enabled, after the CPU writes samples it must
`SCB_CleanDCache_by_Addr()` that region so the DMA reads the fresh data from SRAM and not stale
cache. The buffer is `ALIGN_32BYTES` to match the 32-byte cache-line granularity of those
maintenance operations.

### Clocking

- **CPU / bus clocks** come from **HSI** (the 64 MHz internal RC oscillator).
- **The audio sample clock** must be exact, so it is derived from **HSE** (the board's external
  25 MHz crystal) through PLL2, set up inside the BSP driver's `MX_SAI2_ClockConfig()`. PLL2 is used as a source clock for SAI2. For the
  48 kHz family (which includes 96 kHz, currently used in this project) PLL2 produces ≈49.14 MHz
  (HSE 25 MHz ÷ PLL2M 25 = 1 MHz VCO input, ×PLL2N 344 = 344 MHz, ÷PLL2P 7), which the SAI then
  divides down to the exact MCLK and SCK for the requested Fs.

### Schematics

It may be useful to take a look at the schematic, taken from https://www.st.com/resource/en/schematic_pack/mb1381-h750xb-b04.pdf.

# 1. Create the project

- Create a new project in CubeMX.
- Select the STM32H750XBH MCU.
- When asked about configuring the MPU, it doesn't matter what you pick (I picked Yes in this project).

# 2. Configure basics in CubeMX

The BSP driver that we will import later requires the PDM2PCM library, even though we won't be using any of its functionalities in this project.
The PDM2PCM library is only needed for recording audio.

- Activate CRC under `Computing` -> `CRC`.
- Activate PDM2PCM under `Middleware and Software Packs` -> `PDM2PCM`.
- Set the toolchain in `Project Manager` tab to STM32CubeIDE and click `Generate Code`.

# 3. Add driver files

CubeMX does not generate the audio drivers, so you must copy them
in by hand.

STM32CubeMX downloads the STM32CubeH7 MCU Firmware Package (MCU FP) to `~/STM32Cube/Repository/STM32Cube_FW_H7_Vx.x.x`.
If you do not have it, download it from
https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubeh7.html#get-software.

In the table below, each file lives at the **same relative path** in both places: copy it from
that path under the MCU FP root into the same path under your project root.

| Files to copy | Relative path (same in MCU FP and your project) |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `stm32h7xx_hal_sai.h`, `stm32h7xx_hal_sai_ex.h` | `Drivers/STM32H7xx_HAL_Driver/Inc` |
| `stm32h7xx_hal_sai.c`, `stm32h7xx_hal_sai_ex.c` | `Drivers/STM32H7xx_HAL_Driver/Src` |
| `stm32h750b_discovery_audio.{c,h}`, `stm32h750b_discovery_bus.{c,h}`, `stm32h750b_discovery_errno.h` | `Drivers/BSP/STM32H750B-DK` |
| entire `wm8994` folder | `Drivers/BSP/Components/wm8994` |
| `audio.h` | `Drivers/BSP/Components/Common` |

Then create the BSP config header by copying the template and renaming it (in
`Drivers/BSP/STM32H750B-DK`):

- `stm32h750b_discovery_conf_template.h` → `stm32h750b_discovery_conf.h`

# 4. Add code

```

Using HSE as the source clock for SAI2 is recommended since it is more stable than HSI. Use the following `SystemClock_Config` function in `Core/Src/main.c`. Noted are the lines that need to be changed from the default CubeMX generated configuration:

```c
/**
  * @brief System Clock Configuration
  * @retval None
  */
void SystemClock_Config(void)
{
  RCC_OscInitTypeDef RCC_OscInitStruct = {0};
  RCC_ClkInitTypeDef RCC_ClkInitStruct = {0};

  /** Supply configuration update enable
  */
  HAL_PWREx_ConfigSupply(PWR_LDO_SUPPLY);

  /** Configure the main internal regulator output voltage
  */
  __HAL_PWR_VOLTAGESCALING_CONFIG(PWR_REGULATOR_VOLTAGE_SCALE3);

  while(!__HAL_PWR_GET_FLAG(PWR_FLAG_VOSRDY)) {}

  /** Initializes the RCC Oscillators according to the specified parameters
  * in the RCC_OscInitTypeDef structure.
  */
  RCC_OscInitStruct.OscillatorType = RCC_OSCILLATORTYPE_HSI | RCC_OSCILLATORTYPE_HSE; // NOTE: changed from the default CubeMX project
  RCC_OscInitStruct.HSIState = RCC_HSI_DIV1;
  RCC_OscInitStruct.HSICalibrationValue = RCC_HSICALIBRATION_DEFAULT;
  RCC_OscInitStruct.HSEState = RCC_HSE_ON; // NOTE: changed from the default CubeMX project
  RCC_OscInitStruct.PLL.PLLState = RCC_PLL_NONE;
  if (HAL_RCC_OscConfig(&RCC_OscInitStruct) != HAL_OK)
  {
    Error_Handler();
  }

  __HAL_RCC_PLL_PLLSOURCE_CONFIG(RCC_PLLSOURCE_HSE);  // NOTE: changed from the default CubeMX project

  /** Initializes the CPU, AHB and APB buses clocks
  */
  RCC_ClkInitStruct.ClockType = RCC_CLOCKTYPE_HCLK|RCC_CLOCKTYPE_SYSCLK
                              |RCC_CLOCKTYPE_PCLK1|RCC_CLOCKTYPE_PCLK2
                              |RCC_CLOCKTYPE_D3PCLK1|RCC_CLOCKTYPE_D1PCLK1;
  RCC_ClkInitStruct.SYSCLKSource = RCC_SYSCLKSOURCE_HSI;
  RCC_ClkInitStruct.SYSCLKDivider = RCC_SYSCLK_DIV1;
  RCC_ClkInitStruct.AHBCLKDivider = RCC_HCLK_DIV1;
  RCC_ClkInitStruct.APB3CLKDivider = RCC_APB3_DIV1;
  RCC_ClkInitStruct.APB1CLKDivider = RCC_APB1_DIV1;
  RCC_ClkInitStruct.APB2CLKDivider = RCC_APB2_DIV1;
  RCC_ClkInitStruct.APB4CLKDivider = RCC_APB4_DIV1;

  if (HAL_RCC_ClockConfig(&RCC_ClkInitStruct, FLASH_LATENCY_1) != HAL_OK)
  {
    Error_Handler();
  }
}
```

Add the following code to `Core/Src/stm32h7xx_it.c`:
```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */
/**
  * @brief  This function handles DMA2 Stream 1 interrupt request
  *         (SAI2 Block A: audio out to the WM8994 codec).
  */
void AUDIO_OUT_SAIx_DMAx_IRQHandler(void)
{
  BSP_AUDIO_OUT_IRQHandler(0);
}
/* USER CODE END 1 */
```

# 5. Update include path in STM32CubeIDE

Open the project in STM32CubeIDE and navigate to `Project` → `Properties` → `C/C++ Build` → `Settings` → `MCU/MPU GCC Compiler` → `Include Paths`:
  - Add `../Drivers/BSP/STM32H750B-DK` under `Include paths (-I)`

# 6. Build and flash the project

Build and flash the project from STM32CubeIDE.


# Notes

Adjust your speaker/headphones volume before running this example. Volume can also be changed through `AudioOutInit.Volume` in `main.c` or by changing the `AMPLITUDE` in `main.h`.
